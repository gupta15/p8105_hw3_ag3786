**Problem 1**
-------------

### Importing the CSV and data cleaning

-   Importing the BRFSS dataset from p8105.datasets.
-   Cleaning variable names
-   Focusing on the topic "Overall Health"
-   Formatted the data to keep only the useful variables
-   Arranged reponses ordered from Excellent to Poor

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010)
```

``` r
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
    mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>%
  arrange(response)
```

### Answering questions using the cleaned dataset

-   Question 1: In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(location_count = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter(location_count == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

| locationabbr |  location\_count|
|:-------------|----------------:|
| CT           |                7|
| FL           |                7|
| NC           |                7|

In the year 2002, **3 states namely Connecticut, Florida and North Carolina**, were observed at 7 locations.

-   Question 2: Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = 1.0,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "right"))

brfss %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(location_count = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  rename(states = locationabbr) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = location_count)) + geom_smooth(aes(color = states), se = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of distinct locations",
    caption = "Data from the BRFSS package"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

-   Question 3: Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

-   Question 4: For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

brfss %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>% 
  summarise(avg_response = mean(data_value)) %>% 
  rename(states = locationabbr) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_response)) + geom_smooth(aes(color = states), se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ response) +
  labs(
    title = "State-level averages of response categories over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average responses",
    caption = "Data from the BRFSS package"
  )
```
